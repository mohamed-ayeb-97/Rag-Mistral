# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Mistral

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using Mistral as the Language Model (LLM). RAG is a technique that combines document retrieval with sequence generation, enhancing the ability of the model to produce contextually relevant and accurate responses based on external documents.

## Overview

The notebook `rag-mistral.ipynb` showcases the following:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **Model Setup**: Configuring the Mistral LLM for RAG.
3. **Retrieval Mechanism**: Implementing a document retrieval system to fetch relevant documents.
4. **Generation Process**: Generating responses using the retrieved documents to provide more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the RAG model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `transformers`, `datasets`, `faiss`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-ayeb-97/Rag-Mistral.git
cd Rag-Mistral
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook rag-mistral.ipynb
```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to run the RAG model with Mistral.

## Results

The notebook includes examples of how the RAG model can retrieve and generate responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. The results section evaluates the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses.
